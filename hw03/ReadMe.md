1. tmp101.sh reads two tmp101 sensors
2. tmp101.py reads two tmp101 sensors on i2c bus 2 at 0x49 and 0x4a. It outputs the temperature triggered by the alert pin.
3. etch-and-sketch uses two rotary encoders on eQEP1 and eQEP2 to move the curser. 
4. run setup.sh to config the pins for tmp101 and rotary encoders.
